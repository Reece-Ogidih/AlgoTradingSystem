# CT-Bot

A crypto trading bot focused on short-term trades, designed to automate and optimize trading decisions using machine learning and market sentiment analysis.

## Project Overview

CT-Bot aims to execute trades on behalf of users by combining:

- **Machine Learning models** trained on historical and live paper trading data to identify profitable trade signals.
- **Market sentiment analysis** integrating social media, news, and other data sources to refine trading decisions.

The bot will initially support the **Solana** blockchain, with plans to expand to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

## Features (Planned)

- Connects securely to user wallets to execute trades automatically.
- Utilizes real-time and historical market data for decision making.
- Implements machine learning algorithms for trade signal prediction.
- Incorporates sentiment analysis to account for market mood.
- Supports paper trading for backtesting and training without risking real funds.
- Modular architecture with backend services in Go and ML components in Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.x installed
- Python 3.x installed
- Access to Solana API endpoints or node for blockchain interaction
- API keys for exchange and sentiment data sources (TBD)

### Installation

(To be added once the initial project structure and dependencies are defined.)

## Usage

(To be added as features are developed.)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Design and implement wallet integration for Solana.
- [ ] Collect and preprocess historical market data.
- [ ] Develop and train initial ML models for short-term trade prediction.
- [ ] Build sentiment analysis module.
- [ ] Integrate ML and sentiment modules into the trading bot engine.
- [ ] Enable paper trading mode.
- [ ] Develop user interface and controls.
